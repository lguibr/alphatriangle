# AlphaTriangle

<img src="bitmap.png" alt="AlphaTriangle Logo" width="300"/>

## Overview

AlphaTriangle is a project implementing an artificial intelligence agent based on AlphaZero principles to learn and play a custom puzzle game involving placing triangular shapes onto a grid. The agent learns through **headless self-play reinforcement learning**, guided by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a deep neural network (PyTorch).

**Key Features:**

*   **Core Game Logic:** Uses the [`trianglengin>=2.0.1`](https://github.com/lguibr/trianglengin) library for the triangle puzzle game rules and state management, featuring a high-performance C++ core.
*   **High-Performance MCTS:** Integrates the [`trimcts`](https://github.com/lguibr/trimcts) library, providing a **C++ implementation of MCTS** for efficient search, callable from Python. MCTS parameters are configurable via `alphatriangle/config/mcts_config.py` (defaulting to 64 simulations for faster testing/profiling, adjust as needed).
*   **Deep Learning Model:** Features a PyTorch neural network with policy and distributional value heads, convolutional layers, and **optional Transformer Encoder layers**.
*   **Parallel Self-Play:** Leverages **Ray** for distributed self-play data generation across multiple CPU cores.
*   **Experiment Tracking:** Uses **MLflow** and **TensorBoard** for logging parameters, metrics, and artifacts, enabling web-based monitoring.
*   **Headless Training:** Focuses on a command-line interface for running the training pipeline without visual output.
*   **Unit Tests:** Includes tests for RL components.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (for development):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lguibr/alphatriangle.git
    cd alphatriangle
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install the package (including `trianglengin` and `trimcts`):**
    *   **For users:**
        ```bash
        # This will automatically install trianglengin and trimcts from PyPI if available
        pip install alphatriangle
        # Or install directly from Git (installs dependencies from PyPI)
        # pip install git+https://github.com/lguibr/alphatriangle.git
        ```
    *   **For developers (editable install):**
        *   First, ensure `trianglengin` and `trimcts` are installed (ideally in editable mode from their own directories if developing all three):
            ```bash
            # From the trianglengin directory (requires C++ build tools):
            # pip install -e .
            # From the trimcts directory (requires C++ build tools):
            # pip install -e .
            ```
        *   Then, install `alphatriangle` in editable mode:
            ```bash
            # From the alphatriangle directory:
            pip install -e .
            # Install dev dependencies (optional, for running tests/linting)
            pip install -e .[dev] # Installs dev deps from pyproject.toml
            ```
    *Note: Ensure you have the correct PyTorch version installed for your system (CPU/CUDA/MPS). See [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/). Ray may have specific system requirements. `trianglengin` and `trimcts` require a C++ compiler (like GCC, Clang, or MSVC) and CMake.*
4.  **(Optional) Add data directory to `.gitignore`:**
    Create or edit the `.gitignore` file in your project root and add the line:
    ```
    .alphatriangle_data/
    ```

## Running the Code (CLI)

Use the `alphatriangle` command for training:

*   **Show Help:**
    ```bash
    alphatriangle --help
    ```
*   **Run Training (Headless Only):**
    ```bash
    alphatriangle train [--seed 42] [--log-level INFO]
    ```
*   **Interactive Play/Debug (Use `trianglengin` CLI):**
    *Note: Interactive modes are part of the `trianglengin` library, not this `alphatriangle` package.*
    ```bash
    # Ensure trianglengin is installed
    trianglengin play [--seed 42] [--log-level INFO]
    trianglengin debug [--seed 42] [--log-level DEBUG]
    ```
*   **Monitoring Training (Web Dashboards):**
    This project uses **MLflow** and **TensorBoard** to provide web-based dashboards for monitoring. It's recommended to run both concurrently for the best experience:
    *   **MLflow UI (Experiment Overview & Artifacts):**
        Provides the main dashboard for comparing runs, viewing parameters, high-level metrics, and accessing saved artifacts (checkpoints, buffers). Updates occur as data is logged, but may require a browser refresh for the latest points.
        ```bash
        # Run from the project root directory
        mlflow ui --backend-store-uri file:./.alphatriangle_data/mlruns
        ```
        Access via `http://localhost:5000`.
    *   **TensorBoard (Near Real-Time Graphs):**
        Offers more frequently updated graphs of scalar metrics (losses, rates, etc.) during a run, making it ideal for closely monitoring training progress.
        ```bash
        # Run from the project root directory, pointing to the *specific run's* TB logs
        tensorboard --logdir .alphatriangle_data/runs/<your_run_name>/tensorboard
        # Replace <your_run_name> with the actual name (e.g., train_20240101_120000)
        # You can also point to the parent 'runs' directory to see all runs:
        # tensorboard --logdir .alphatriangle_data/runs
        ```
        Access via `http://localhost:6006`.
*   **Running Unit Tests (Development):**
    ```bash
    pytest tests/
    ```

## Configuration

All major parameters for the AlphaZero agent (Model, Training, Persistence, **MCTS**) are defined in the Pydantic classes within the `alphatriangle/config/` directory. Modify these files to experiment with different settings. Environment configuration (`EnvConfig`) is defined within the `trianglengin` library.

## Data Storage

All persistent data is stored within the `.alphatriangle_data/` directory in the project root.
*   **`.alphatriangle_data/mlruns/`**: Managed by **MLflow**. Contains MLflow's internal tracking data (parameters, metrics) and its own copy of logged artifacts. This is the source for the MLflow UI.
*   **`.alphatriangle_data/runs/`**: Managed by **DataManager**. Contains locally saved artifacts for each run (checkpoints, buffers, TensorBoard logs, configs) before/during logging to MLflow. This directory is used for auto-resuming and direct access to TensorBoard logs during a run.

## Maintainability

This project includes README files within each major `alphatriangle` submodule. **Please keep these READMEs updated** when making changes to the code's structure, interfaces, or core logic.
